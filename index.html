    <HTML - INDEX PAGE>                                   

Welcome to Tung Nguyen's 2021 Website source code. This website consists of 5 pages, connected in a 
network-web structure (where the user can navigate through all websites regardless of the starting position).
ALL of my sites have the same code for the header, footer, the "back to top" button and the navigation bar

This page is the index page, the first page of the website, which has 3 distinct component (other from the ones
mentioned above): 
1. Welcome block, 2. "Brief about me" block, 3. "Banner one block".
See below for more details -->

			<!-- The entry banner, this is one out of 3 entrance banners that exist on this website. For noting purpose, I have breached the rule
			of "putting images in-line with text" underneath. However, this is how I utilize animated GIF to allow me to do the visual fx that
			I have not yet able to implement. Basically, next to "This is" text, there will be a changing logo with glitching effect, constantly
			switching between the word "ME" and my logo, which is presented in most places. With onclick attribute, clicking on it will direct
			you to about page, like the logo in the header-->

			<div id="index-content" > <!-- To differentiate different main blocks, I have IDed each one of them. This block is named "index-content"
				which will be affected by the styling that has the selector #index-content in the css files. -->
				<h2 class=" mcon title">a brief about me.</h2>
				<!-- Some clarification on the class I have named here. All styling can be seen in the stylesheets with the classes announced:
				1. mcon: short for main content, this indicates each block that are nested in the main component (like index-content)
				2. text: are the generic class for every blocks that have texts in it. This will be used mainly to decide the font colour and family
				3. content-text: this defines the text sits inside a content blocks.
				4. title: This defines the title of every content "block", which should appear differently -->

				<p class="text content-text mcon">As a third-year Information and Communication Technology Bachelor's student at the Swinburne
					University of Technology with a background in IT and business information systems, I aspire to learn
					more about Information Systems, the exploration of data and how such processes provide value to many
					existing and up-and-coming businesses.<br><br>
					However, I also spend my time and effort looking into the field of graphical design, and where that might collide with ICT, in order to bring
					both fields' skillsets into effective use.
					Being an international student also bring certain hardships to my effort to gain a place in the Australian's workforce, but by being a hard-worker,
					curious, self-discipline and a problem solver, I yearns to achieve more.
