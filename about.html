<!--  				<HTML - ABOUT PAGE>                                   

Welcome to Tung Nguyen's 2021 Website source code. This website consists of 5 pages, connected in a 
network-web structure (where the user can navigate through all websites regardless of the starting position).
ALL of my sites have the same code for the header, entrance banner, footer, the "back to top" button and the navigation bar

This page is the ABOUT page, where you can find most of the things you need to know about me:
1. My Hobbies, 2. My Achievements, 3. Stuffs that I have graphically designed (digitally), 4. Life in Australia
See below for more details -->

			<!-- THis is the newly introduced element/section, the "internal-navigation" list

			This navigation list will take you through many parts of the website. (3 to be specific)-->

				<!-- Here are the explanation to the classes that I used underneath:
				1. mcon: short for main content, this indicates each block that are nested in the main component (like nation-content)
				2. text: are the generic class for every blocks that have texts in it. This will be used mainly to decide the font colour and family
				3. content-text: this defines the text sits inside a content blocks.
				4. title: This defines the title of every content "block", which should appear differently
				t. hobby-list: this basically is grouping method that I used on the two ordered lists-->
